INSTRUCTIONS: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY

1st step: Go to stripe.com and obtain your LIVE secret API key as well as the Price ID for the subscription plan you want to use.
Then use those details to fill the fields: STRIPE_KEY and PRICE_ID in the .env file Stripe Dashboard search is a
great tool if you get stuck.

2nd step OPTIONAL: If you want, replace CANCEL_URL and SUCCESS_URL in the .env file with urls you want your customers to be
redirected to after cancelling or subscribing. I have set them up as your home page.

3rd step: Deploy your application to the cloud. I recommend the site railway.app. If you want, use my referral link
as it will help me a lot and give you some free credits! https://railway.app?referralCode=d-cKM4 Should you need help with
deployment, please contact me for free guidance or for deployment services for a fee.

4th step: Obtain your deployment link from railway and go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks to set up webhooks for your application.
The page the API listens for webhooks is "/webhooks". So the url you should use is: YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_LINK/webhooks
The webhooks the application will use are: payment_method.attached. Should you encounter any issues with the webhooks, please contact me.
Ill provide you with a solution for free.

5th step: Once you have set up the webhook url, obtain its secret key from the stripe dashboard.
Then use that key to fill the field: WEBHOOK_SECRET in the .env file.

6th step: Redeploy your application to the cloud.

NOTE: Your application files will be available in my personal cloud storage for 90 days
in case you need additional features in the future.
